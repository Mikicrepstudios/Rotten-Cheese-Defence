## About This Game
In this game, you play as a face located at the bottom of the screen. Your objective is to lick the cheese to rot it. You must prevent the cheese from remaining unrotted. The cheese resists rotting, but you love the color of rotten cheese, which is why you rot it.

You can select the difficulty level from the main menu:
- **Easy**: 1000ms
- **Normal**: 750ms
- **Hard**: 500ms
- **Insane**: 250ms

The selected difficulty level changes the time it takes for the cheese to unrot accordingly.
